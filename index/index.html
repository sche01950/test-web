                                <p>Starting off with a banger this month! Pokémon Concierge was a long awaited joy for
                                    me to
                                    watch and be immersed in. So much dedication and detail in only 4 little episodes. I
                                    feel like this show perfectly represents the world that we dreamed was real when we
                                    were
                                    kids imagining Pokémon living and interacting with us. I need more of this from The
                                    pokémon company, more creativity given to the artists who clearly didn't shy away
                                    from
                                    making a masterpiece. More fluffy pokémon please.

                                <p>This game is wild... I ended up humping and jerking furiously in front of my girlfriend's parents playing this game but for some reason I was willingly doing it. I'm sorry Steve. My first entry into the Warioware franchise was a blast. The art style and everything else involved in the game is perfect. My only gripe really is the weird MarioParty-esque thing they have for local play, the board is way too small and the minigames aren't long enough on their own to make it worthwhile.
