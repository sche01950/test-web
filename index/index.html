                            <h3>Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo (ヱヴァンゲリオン新劇場版)</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p> The third film in the Rebuild of Evangelion movie series
                            the storyline departs markedly from where Evangelion 2.0 had ended, and is the first film in
                            the Rebuild series to comprise of entirely new work. Its position in the telling of the
                            story appears to correspond to the End of Evangelion segment of the original series. Very
                            few of the story elements hinted at in the original preview from 2.0 remain in the final
                            work. </p>

                        <p>
                            The story begins 14 years after the events of the previous film. Most of Nerv's original
                            adult staff, sans Gendo and Fuyutsuki, now belong to an organization called Wille (German
                            for "will"), led by Captain Misato Katsuragi, and including Eva pilots Asuka (in Eva-02) and
                            Mari (in the new Eva-08), Toji's sister Sakura, and several new characters. Shinji has been
                            absorbed inside Eva-01 all this time, which is now orbiting earth inside a giant cuboidal
                            cross-shaped satellite.

                            <h3>Celeste</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p>The game follows a young woman named Madeline as she climbs the somewhat magical Celeste
                            Mountain, facing opposition from both the mountain's natural obstacles and from within
                            herself.</p>

                        <p>Celeste's gameplay features fast and tight controls along a series of challenging platforming
                            sublevels that make up a larger Chapter. It follows the simple to learn and hard to master
                            controls that are a staple of its genre, and gameplay has often been compared to others,
                            like Super Meat Boy. Seriously it's really fucking hard.</p>
